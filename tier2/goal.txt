The goal of this tier is to get more blocks going in a rational way.
1. Add textures to the block.
2. Draw lots of blocks in a reasonably efficient way.
3. Make sure that you are not comitting any major sins when rendering. 
4. Optionally support rendering in two stages, one for transparents and one for opaques.
